# Chess-Analysis

This project analyzes my chess matches on Chess.com by using the chessR Package created by Jason Zivkovic. I use a multivariate logistic regression model to make predictions on my previous matches and find the accuracy of the model.

The Chess-Analysis.R file contains all the code for this project. There are also files for the visualizations used in the Medium article on my account (@KyleGalsky).
